## What is this?

This one here is a custom starter page for chrome (just a fun side project) which is written in NextJS with TS, tailwindcss & daisyui for UI Components.

## What works by now?

- The styling is working and responsive
- the search functionality is there
- a dropdown menu is added which houses a few fav. links

## Currently in dev.

- fix some styling issues/site overflow/ profilepic not loading/ etc.
- link up the fav's
- editing capability
- pretty much everything lol
